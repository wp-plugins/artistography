Artistography allows you to have a discography on a record label of artists with inter-linked featurings and collaborations among them, or outside artists.

== Description ==

Artistography allows a user to organize albums and videos onto an artist page.  The artist page has jQuery-UI style tabs, and polls tags on posts for the artist's name and then files them into the Related Posts tab.

== Installation ==

1. Install the Artisography plugin to your blog, and Activate it.  
2. Next, Enter an Artist into the Admin/Dashboard > Artistography > Artists
3. To populate the artist's Related Posts tab just tag posts with the Artist's name.  Artistography will automatically find it.
4. Use the following shortcodes on a page/post:

[artistography_display_artist_page]
     Displays artist photo/bio, discography, videos, related posts, etc.
